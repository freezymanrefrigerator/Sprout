### Nexy Possible Improvements:

1. Security and Access Control -
This will prioritizes security through user role management. Different roles (Admin, Manager, Employee) have specific access rights, ensuring only authorized functionalities 
are allowed. This protects sensitive data. Regular reviews and updates maintain a secure and reliable application.

2. User Salary Management -
The application provides the possibility to add and edit user salaries based on their role and employment type. Admin and Manager roles can perform these actions, 
while Employees have read-only access to their own salary information. This ensures transparency and accountability in managing employee compensation.

3. Audit Log - 
An audit log feature is implemented to track user activities within the site. This log captures important moments, such as login attempts, data modifications, 
and access to sensitive information. The audit log enhances security and assists in identifying any suspicious activities or unauthorized access.

4. Global Settings and Configurability - To cater to different client needs and enhance configurability, this web application implements global settings.
These settings allow administrators to customize various aspects of the application, such as:

* Appearance: Control the site's theme, colors, and branding to match the client's identity.
* Notification Preferences: Enable or disable email notifications and set notification frequency.
* Data Retention: Configure data retention policies for user records and activity logs.
* Password Policies: Set password complexity requirements and expiration periods.
* User Role Customization: Define custom roles and their access levels to align with specific organizational structures.

5. Reporting Functionality - the web application should include comprehensive reporting capabilities to empower clients and users with valuable insights.The reporting module provides:

* Predefined Reports: A set of predefined reports that cover common business metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs).
* Historical Employee Data: Access past employee records, allowing users to track changes in employee details, salaries, and employment status over time.
